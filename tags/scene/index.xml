      <description>A common technique used for speech (and sound) analysis is Cepstral analysis. For discrete-time signals, the cepstrum is defined as the inverse discrete-time Fourier Transform of the natural logarithm of the discrete-time Fourier Transform of the signal.
 Human create speech signals through a series of controlled movements of their lungs, vocal cords, tongue, and lips. Speech can be separated into two sound types, voiced and unvoiced. Voiced speech has a roughly regular pattern in its time-frequency structure whereas unvoiced speach does not.</description>
